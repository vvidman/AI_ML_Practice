## Loading and preraring data

# Sample dataset: Study hours and whether students passed or failed
data = {
    'StudyHours': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    'Pass': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # 0 = Fail, 1 = Pass
}

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the first few rows of the data
print(df.head()) 

## Splitting the data into training and testing sets

# Features (X) and Target (y)
X = df[['StudyHours']]  # Feature(s)
y = df['Pass']          # Target variable (0 = Fail, 1 = Pass)

# Split data into 80% training and 20% testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Display the shape of the training and testing sets
print(f"Training data: {X_train.shape}, {y_train.shape}")
print(f"Testing data: {X_test.shape}, {y_test.shape}")

## Training the logistic regression model

# Initialize the Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Display the model's learned coefficients
print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_}")
print(f"Coefficient: {model.coef_[0]}")

## Making predictions

# Make predictions on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Display the predictions
print("Predicted Outcomes (Pass/Fail):", y_pred)
print("Actual Outcomes:", y_test.values)

## Evaluating the model

'''
To evaluate how well the logistic regression model performed, weâ€™ll use several metrics, 
including accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report (which includes precision, recall, and F1 score):
'''

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Generate confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Generate classification report
class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

# Display evaluation metrics
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(conf_matrix)
print("Classification Report:")
print(class_report)

## Visualizing the results

# Create a range of study hours for plotting
study_hours_range = np.linspace(X.min(), X.max(), 100)

# Calculate predicted probabilities using the sigmoid function
y_prob = model.predict_proba(study_hours_range.reshape(-1, 1))[:, 1]

# Plot the actual data points
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='blue', label='Actual Data')

# Plot the logistic regression curve
plt.plot(study_hours_range, y_prob, color='red', label='Logistic Regression Curve')

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Study Hours')
plt.ylabel('Probability of Passing')
plt.title('Logistic Regression: Study Hours vs. Pass/Fail')
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
